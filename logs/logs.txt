Seems like either... 

1. Chrome is already running. 
A. Close all Chrome windows and try again. 

2. Google Chrome or Chromedriver is out dated. 
A. Update browser and Chromedriver (You can run "windows-setup.bat" in /setup folder for Windows PC to update Chromedriver)! 

3. If error occurred when using "stealth_mode", try reinstalling undetected-chromedriver. 
A. Open a terminal and use commands "pip uninstall undetected-chromedriver" and "pip install undetected-chromedriver". 


If issue persists, try Safe Mode. Set, safe_mode = True in config.py

About the job
Location: Remote / India preferred (flexible)
Type: Full-time / Contract (Immediate start)
Salary: Competitive - decided based on performance during interview

About the role:
We are looking for a Junior Software Developer who can learn quickly, switch between tasks, and solve problems in real time. You’ll work directly with senior developers, get daily guidance, and contribute to real projects.

Important: The entire interview will be live on Zoom. No written tests or take-home tasks. Be ready to share your screen, answer questions, and solve problems on the spot. If you do well, you will be hired the same day.

What you'll do:
Support senior developers with ongoing work
Write and maintain code in Node.js, Python, and Go (familiarity with at least one required)
Debug and troubleshoot issues in real time
Work comfortably in Linux (basic terminal and system tasks)
Assist with basic networking and simple cybersecurity tasks
Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to research and solve problems quickly
Learn and improve daily with feedback from senior developers

What we'll expect from you:
Good understanding of basic programming concepts
Hands-on experience with Node.js, Python, or Go
Comfortable using Linux regularly
Basic knowledge of networking (ports, SSH, curl, etc.); cybersecurity is a plus
Ability to stay calm and solve problems under pressure
Resourceful - able to use documentation, forums, and AI tools effectively
Clear communication skills
Willingness to learn and take feedback

Nice-to-have:
Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, or CI/CD
Knowledge of databases (Postgres, MySQL, Redis)
Familiarity with logs, monitoring, or tracing tools
Some exposure to cybersecurity tools or networking diagnostics


Interview Process:
Format: Live Zoom call
Steps:
Short introduction
Live technical Q&A (programming, Linux, networking)
Screen sharing for problem-solving tasks (debugging, small coding tasks)
You may use any tools you like (editor, terminal, ChatGPT, Gemini) but you must solve the problem live
Hiring decision made the same day

Note:
No written exam
No take-home assignment
Only apply if you’re confident in your basics and can handle live problem-solving

Why Join Us:
Daily mentorship from senior developers
Exposure to different programming languages and tools
Real learning through hands-on work
Growth opportunities based on performance

How to Apply:
Send your resume (1 page is fine) and a short note with: the language you’re strongest in and one technical problem you solved recently.
Apply only if you:
Can solve problems live on Zoom
Are comfortable using AI tools as support
Want to learn and grow quickly


One last thing - straight talk:
If you need extra time, written tests, or step-by-step instructions, this job may not be for you. We are looking for candidates who can think on their feet and solve problems in real time. If that sounds like you, come prepared - we’re hiring today.

Good luck. Bring coffee (or whatever keeps you human).

Fine-tune and adapt models for specific tasks and domains.
Build and maintain pipelines for data curation, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and continuous improvement of models.
Implement debugging, CI/CD, and observability to ensure reliability and efficiency across the development lifecycle.
Develop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and optimize prompt engineering strategies.
Optimize training and inference performance through quantization, distributed training/inference, GPU/TPU acceleration.
Monitor, benchmark, and improve model performance with a focus on accuracy, efficiency, and reducing hallucinations.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to build robust AI stacks and integrate them seamlessly into production pipelines for deployment.
Document technical processes, AI model architectures, and experimental results, while maintaining well-structured, version-controlled code repositories.
Stay current with advancements in transformer architectures, open-source releases, and AI tooling.


Minimum Qualifications and Experience:
Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science, AI/ML, Data Science or any related field with 2 to 5 years of industry experience in applied machine learning or AI development.

Required Expertise: 
Proficiency in Python programming with solid foundation in computer science fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms.
Strong problem-solving skills and demonstrated ability to lead projects.
Hands-on experience with a few of the tools listed below: 
One or more model libraries and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, HF Transformers, NeMo, etc.
AI application libraries and orchestration frameworks such as DSPy, Langgraph, Langchain, Llamaindex, etc.
GPU/TPU based training and inference using libraries such as vLLM.
Distributed training tools such as SLURM, Ray, Pytorch DDP, NCCL, etc.
Version control, observability systems, and MLOps tools such as Git, DVC, W&B, MLFlow, KubeFlow, etc.
Data analysis and curation tools such as Dask, Milvus, Apache Spark, Numpy, etc.
Chunking, embeddings, vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Model context protocol (MCP), Agent to Agent (A2A), and Agent Communication Protocol (ACP).
Team player with excellent interpersonal skills and ability to collaborate effectively with remote team members.
Go-getter attitude and ability to flourish in a fast-paced, startup environment.
Prior experience of building and deploying LLMs or SLMs, experience with multimodal models, and track record of contributions to open-source AI/ML projects would be a big plus.
