The __pycache__ folder in  app (or any Python project) is automatically created by Python when you run your program.

It stores compiled bytecode files (with the .pyc extension) for your Python scripts.
For example, if you have a file main.py, Python compiles it to main.cpython-311.pyc and puts it inside __pycache__.
